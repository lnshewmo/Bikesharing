View the NYC Citibikes Story on Tableau Public **[here.](https://public.tableau.com/views/CitiBike_Challenge_16616353157500/Story1?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)**

### Resources
 - **Data:** from the CitiBike System Data [page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/tripdata/index.html), the selected set is 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv.zip
 - Tableau Public 2022.2
 - Jupyter Notebook 6.4.8
 - Pandas library - trip duration data from the 201908-citibike-tripdata.csv file was converted to a *datetime* datatype **([here](https://github.com/lnshewmo/Bikesharing/blob/main/NYC_Citibike_Challenge.ipynb))** before uploading to Tableau.
  
### Overview

Visualizations using the NYC CitiBikes dataset were prepared for an investor meeting to demonstrate proof of concept for a similar bikesharing venture in Des Moines, Iowa.  The selected dataset represents the month of August (2019) which was determined to be an optimal month for bike rentals.

### Results

Total ridership for August:  2,344,224 rides
Breakdown of subscribers vs. short-term customers:  



- what are the daily peak times for trips? (total # bikes needed, when can maintenance be performed)
- what are the highest-traffic starting locations?
- what are the highest-traffic ending locations?
- are the trends in customer demographics?
- how long is an average trip? (duration by age, gender, etc)
- which bikes need repair? (sum of number of rides and sum of trip durations)
- how long are bikes checked out for all riders and genders
- how many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week for all riders and genders
- what days of the week is a user more likely to rent a bike (usertype, gender)
