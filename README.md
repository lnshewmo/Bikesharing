### Overview

Visualizations using the NYC CitiBikes dataset were prepared for an investor meeting to demonstrate proof of concept for a similar venture in Des Moines, Iowa.  The selected dataset represents the month of August (2019) which was determined to be an optimal month for bike rentals.

Questions:
- what is the total ridership for August?
- what is the breakdown of subscribers vs. short-term customers?
- what are the daily peak times for trips? (total # bikes needed, when can maintenance be performed)
- what are the highest-traffic starting locations?
- what are the highest-traffic ending locations?
- are the trends in customer demographics?
- how long is an average trip? (duration by age, gender, etc)
- which bikes need repair? (sum of number of rides and sum of trip durations)
------------
- how long are bikes checked out for all riders and genders
- how many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week for all riders and genders
- what days of the week is a user more likely to rent a bike (usertype, gender)
